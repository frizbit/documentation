# Getting Started
## Introduction

So you have decided to give [Frizbit](https://frizbit.com "push notification for your web applications") a try, but you are not sure where to begin. Have no fear, this step-by-step guide will help you how to get started and send push notifications to reach your users.

## What is Frizbit?
Frizbit is a simple and reliable push notification platform built for websites. 

## Starting with Frizbit
Make sure you have [signed up](https://frizbit.com "push notification for your web applications") for an account before continuing, since you will need a key to authenticate to the frizbit services.

## Basic Installation
The following installation steps will get Frizbit working on your website. 

1. Go to the Frizbit dashboard, and open Website Settings->Frizbit javascript. Copy the script shown there as below, which will include your API Key.

    <script src='//cdn.frizbit.com/frizbitjs/[YOUR FRIZBIT APP KEY].js' async></script>
  
2. Using your website's dashboard paste this code just above the closing **</head>** tag.

3. Download installation files and copy to root folder.

4. Initialize the FrizbitJS on your pages.

# API References

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittens

## Get All Kittens

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get
```

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittens.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittens"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let kittens = api.kittens.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json

    "id": 1,
